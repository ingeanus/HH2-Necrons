\subsection{Strategical Timeweaver} \label{Strategical Timeweaver}

When an opponent declares a Shooting Attack or Fights this unit or a unit it is attached to, this reaction may be declared. The triggering unit must re-roll all successful To Hit and To Wound rolls against the reacting unit until the end of the attack, keeping the second result. This re-roll occurs even if the triggering unit's rules (e.g. Shred, Hatred, etc.) have already re-rolled these dice. This reaction may only be used once per game for each unit that is able to make use of this reaction.
