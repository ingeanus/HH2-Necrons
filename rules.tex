\subsubsection{Drawn to Blood} \label{Drawn to Blood}

A model with this special rule must start the game in Reserve or Infiltrate. Each time an enemy unit is completely destroyed the Necron player may move one unit with the Flayer sub-type from Reserve into Ongoing Reserve, even if this means that a unit will appear turn One. Independent Characters may be attached to their units when entering.

\subsubsection{Nodal Command (Tier)} \label{Nodal Command}

This rule is accompanied by a tier of Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. Each tier provides a specified range known as Nodal Range, which many other abilities reference for their effects. Any unit within Nodal Range of this unit may use its Leadership in place of its own and units with the \quickref{Soulless Hordes} sub-type may ignore the Engrammatic Attack Patterns provision. The highest tier unit in your army \textit{must} be your Warlord.

	D6 & Result \\
	1 & \textbf{Berserk:} The noble is seized by murderous fury and unable to tell friend from foe. If part of an infantry unit, resolve D3 automatic hits on that unit using the noble's weapons. If alone, the noble suffers an immediate Wound, with no save allowed. \\

	6 & \textbf{Transfiguration:} The noble is transfigured by madness, their auto-repair system distorting their form to express the malignance that consumes them. They gains the Fearless and Rage (1) trait until the end of combat. \\
\end{tabular}


\subsubsection{Entropic Strike (X)} \label{Entropic Strike}

When allocating wounds from a Wound Pool from a weapon with this special rule, lower the target model's Armour Save by 1 (e.g. 3+ -> 4+) permanently before making its save. Against Vehicles, an Armour Penetration roll equal to or greater than the listed value lowers the AV of all facings by 1 permanently before resolving the effects. Vehicles with lowered to an AV of 0 are destroyed and removed from the battlefield.

\subsubsection{Ethereal Interceptors} \label{Ethereal Interceptors}

This unit is may perform a separate Deep Strike Assault. Additionally, it may make use of the \quickref{Ethereal Interception} Advanced Reaction.

\subsubsection{Exile Ray (X)} \label{Exile Ray}

When firing a weapon with this special rule, a To Wound roll equal to or higher than the value listed wounds automatically, regardless of the target's Toughness, has the Instant Death special rule, and the victim must re-roll successful Invulnerable saves. Against Vehicles and Buildings, an Armour Penetration roll equal to or higher than the listed value inflicts a Penetrating Hit.

\subsubsection{Gauss (X)} \label{Gauss}

When firing a weapon with this special rule, a To Wound roll equal to or higher than the value listed wounds automatically, regardless of the targetâ€™s Toughness. Against vehicles and buildings, an Armour Penetration roll equal to or higher than the value listed inflicts a Glancing hit.

\subsubsection{Hyperspace Hunters} \label{Hyperspace Hunters}

A unit with this rule specializes in combat make use of movement through hyperspace pocket dimensions. In your Movement Phase, this unit may slip back into hyperspace instead of moving, as long as it did not arrive from Reserves this turn and is not locked in combat or Falling Back. If it does so, remove it from the board and place it into Ongoing Reserves. Models with this rule still make It Will Not Die rolls while placed back into reserves.

\subsubsection{Decurion/Tesserarion Nemesor} \label{Decurion Nemesor} \label{Tesserarion Nemesor}

The Decurion Nemesor / Tesserarion Nemesor special rule grants the following benefits:

\begin{itemize}
	\itemsep 0pt
	\item Rites of War: If a Detachment with the Necron Faction includes at least one model with the Decurion Nemesor special rule then that Detachment may select a single Rite of War. 
	\item Lord of the Legion: An army may only include a maximum of one model with this special rule per 1,000 points. This counts across all Detachments of an army.
	\item A model with this special rule may also include an Immortals, Pariah Lychguard, or Royal Lychguard unit as part of the same Force Organisation slot as the model with the Decurion Nemesor special rule, but must still meet the required \quickref{Awakening Protocols} tier.
\end{itemize}

If multiple units are eligible to take this ability, it can only be taken by those with the highest Nodal Command tier in the force that has not already taken this ability. 

\subsubsection{Reanimation Protocols} \label{Reanimation Protocols}

Whenever a friendly unit with Reanimation Protocols suffers unsaved wounds or resolves an effect causing wounds, and casualties have been removed, total the number of wounds that have been lost among models that were destroyed and put them into a \textbf{Reassembling Pool} and a second \textbf{Reassembling Pool} for wounds that have the Instant Death special rule.

For each wound in the \textbf{Reassembling Pool}, roll a D6, subtracting 1 for wounds in the Instant Death \textbf{Reassembling Pool}. This unit is \textbf{Reanimating} a wound for every 5+ roll. Each time such a unit \textbf{Reanimates} a wound, perform the following steps:

\begin{itemize}
	\itemsep 0pt
	\item If that unit is less than its Starting Strength, return one destroyed model to play in cohesion range with one wound remaining.
	\item Then, if that unit is at its Starting Strength and has models that are missing any wounds, select a model with the lowest remaining wounds; it regains one lost wound.
\end{itemize}

If this unit would be destroyed by the attack or effect, Reanimation Protocols still triggers; perform the process as normal, however after models have been returned from successful \textbf{Reanimation} rolls, if there are remaining wounds in the Wound Pool, continue allocating those to the newly \textbf{Reanimated} models until the Wound Pool is empty or all \textbf{Reanimation} rolls have failed; these remaining wounds \textit{can} cause further Reanimation Protocols triggers. Do note that effects that simply destroy the unit (e.g. Sweeping Advance) do not trigger Reanimation Protocols.

When assigning wounds to units that have multiple models missing any wounds, assign them to the models with the least amount of wounds. In case of ties, the attacking player decides which models to apply them to.

Certain effects can cause models to immediately begin \textbf{Reassembling} or \textbf{Reanimating}; \textbf{Reassembling} models create a \textbf{Reassembling Pool} equal to the lost wounds of those model and then roll for them as normal. \textbf{Reanimating} models immediately follow the steps for \textbf{reanimating} a number of times equal to the wounds of the destroyed model.

\subsubsection{Soulless Hordes (X)} \label{Soulless Hordes}

Models with the Soulless Hordes subtype are subject to the Engrammatic Attack Patterns provision, which has effects dependent on the tier of the subtype:

\paragraph{Bronze:} During the controlling player's Shooting phase and Charge sub-phase, the Soulless Hordes unit must attempt a Shooting Attack if there is an enemy unit within range (they are not forced to charge), and must target the closest enemy unit possible that is within its line of sight and a valid target for a Shooting Attack or Charge. If two or more targets are equally close then the controlling player chooses which will be the target of a Shooting Attack or Charge. Similar to the Fearless rule, this unit cannot choose to fail a Morale check due to the Our Weapons Are Useless special rule. Additionally, they may not make Reactions.

\paragraph{Silver:} During the controlling player's Shooting phase and Charge sub-phase, \textit{if} the unit attempts a Shooting Attack and/or Charge they must target the closest enemy unit possible that is within its line of sight and a valid target for a Shooting Attack or Charge. If two or more targets are equally close then the controlling player chooses which will be the target of a Shooting Attack or Charge. Similar to the Fearless rule, units with this subtype cannot use any Reactions that grant a Cover Save, Armour Save or Invulnerable Save, and cannot choose to fail a Morale check due to the Our Weapons Are Useless special rule.

The \quickref{Command Protocols} trait is able to suppress this sub-type's effects while in Nodal Range.


\subsubsection{Teleporation Reserves} \label{Teleporation Reserves}

%TODO: This

\subsubsection{Tesla (X)} \label{Tesla}

When firing a weapon with this special rule, a To Hit roll equal to or higher than the value listed generates an additional 2 hits. These hits may be applie to the target unit, or to any unit within 2" of the target unit.

\subsubsection{Tomb Guardians} \label{Tomb Guardians}

Only a single unit with the Tomb Guardians rule may be used in any army which is built using the Nodal Command Force Organisation Chart and does not contain any Fortifications, should the army contain Fortifications there is no limit.
