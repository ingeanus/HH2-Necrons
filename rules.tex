The highest tier unit in your army \textit{must} be your Warlord.

\label{Nodal Range}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}

	Platinum & 12" \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}

Against Vehicles, an Armour Penetration roll equal to or greater than the listed value lowers the AV of all facings by 1 permanently before resolving the effects. Vehicles with lowered to an AV of 0 are destroyed and removed from the battlefield.


\subsubsection{Exile Ray (X)} \label{Exile Ray}

\subsubsection{Hyperspace Hunters} \label{Hyperspace Hunters}

A unit with this rule specializes in combat make use of movement through hyperspace pocket dimensions. In your Movement Phase, this unit may slip back into hyperspace instead of moving, as long as it did not arrive from Reserves this turn and is not locked in combat or Falling Back. If it does so, remove it from the board and place it into Ongoing Reserves. Models with this rule still make It Will Not Die rolls while placed back into reserves.

\subsubsection{Decurion/Tesserarion Nemesor} \label{Decurion Nemesor} \label{Tesserarion Nemesor}

The Decurion Nemesor / Tesserarion Nemesor special rule grants the following benefits:

\begin{itemize}
	\itemsep 0pt
	\item Rites of War: If a Detachment with the Necron Faction includes at least one model with the Decurion Nemesor special rule then that Detachment may select a single Rite of War. 
	\item Lord of the Legion: An army may only include a maximum of one model with this special rule per 1,000 points. This counts across all Detachments of an army.
	\item A model with this special rule may also include an Immortals, Pariah Lychguard, or Royal Lychguard unit as part of the same Force Organisation slot as the model with the Decurion Nemesor special rule, but must still meet the required \quickref{Awakening Protocols} tier.
\end{itemize}

If multiple units are eligible to take this ability, it can only be taken by those with the highest Nodal Command tier in the force that has not already taken this ability. 

\subsubsection{Reanimation Protocols} \label{Reanimation Protocols}

Whenever a unit with Reanimation Protocols would suffer wounds, after the opponent's unit's attacks or the effects have been resolved and models have been removed total the number of wounds that have been lost among models that were destroyed, the unit begins \textbf{reassembling} a number of wounds equal to this amount. For each wound that is being reassembled, roll a d6, subtracting 1 for wounds with Instant Death. This unit \textbf{reanimates} a wound for every 5+ roll. Each time such a unit reanimates a wound:

\begin{itemize}
	\itemsep 0pt
	\item If that unit is less than its Starting Strength, return one destroyed model to play in cohesion range with one wound remaining.
	\item Then, if that unit is at its Starting Strength and has models that are missing any wounds, one of the models with the least wounds regains a wound. Controlling player decides in case of ties.
\end{itemize}

When assigning wounds to units that have multiple models missing any wounds, assign them to the models with the lowest amount of wounds. In case of ties, the attacking player decides which models to apply them to.

\subsubsection{Soulless Hordes (X)} \label{Soulless Hordes}

Models with the Soulless Hordes subtype are subject to the Engrammatic Attack Patterns provision, which has effects dependent on the tier of the subtype:

\paragraph{Bronze:} During the controlling player's Shooting phase and Charge sub-phase, the Soulless Hordes unit must attempt a Shooting Attack if there is an enemy unit within range (they are not forced to charge), and must target the closest enemy unit possible that is within its line of sight and a valid target for a Shooting Attack or Charge. If two or more targets are equally close then the controlling player chooses which will be the target of a Shooting Attack or Charge. Similar to the Fearless rule, this unit cannot choose to fail a Morale check due to the Our Weapons Are Useless special rule. Additionally, they may not make Reactions.

\paragraph{Silver:} During the controlling player's Shooting phase and Charge sub-phase, \textit{if} the unit attempts a Shooting Attack and/or Charge they must target the closest enemy unit possible that is within its line of sight and a valid target for a Shooting Attack or Charge. If two or more targets are equally close then the controlling player chooses which will be the target of a Shooting Attack or Charge. Similar to the Fearless rule, units with this subtype cannot use any Reactions that grant a Cover Save, Armour Save or Invulnerable Save, and cannot choose to fail a Morale check due to the Our Weapons Are Useless special rule.

The \quickref{Command Protocols} trait is able to suppress this sub-type's effects while in Nodal Range.
