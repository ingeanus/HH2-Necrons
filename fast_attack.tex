Fabricator Claw Array: In each of your Shooting phases, instead of firing a weapon, a model with a fabricator claw array can choose to repair a single friendly vehicle that it is in base contact with. To repair a vehicle, roll a D6. If the result is a 4 or more, you may either restore a Hull Point lost earlier in the battle or repair a Weapon Destroyed or Immobilised result suffered earlier in the battle; this is effective immediately. \\
Gloom Prison: This model gains the Anathema sub-type. Additionally, any psychic power targeting a unit within 12" of this model is nullified on a 4+. \\
Scarab Hive: Once per friendly Movement phase, each Canoptek Spyder can use this special rule to create Canoptek Scarabs. To do so, nominate a friendly unit of Canoptek Scarabs that is within 6" of the Canoptek Spyder. Add a single Canoptek Scarab base to the unit – this can take the unit beyond its starting size, but must be placed within 6" of the Canoptek Spyder. If a model cannot be placed for any reason, it is destroyed. Canoptek Scarabs created in this manner can move and act normally this turn. Roll a D6 each time a Canoptek Spyder uses its Scarab Hive special rule, immediately after placing any Canoptek Scarabs that were created – on a roll of a 1 the Canoptek Spyder suffers a single Wound with no saves of any kind allowed. In addition, for each unit of Spyders in the army, a unit of Canoptek Scarabs may be taken which do count towards the maximum number of units in their respective Force Organisation slot. \\
