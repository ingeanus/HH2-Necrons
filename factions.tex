\subsection{Mephrit}

Mephrit Dynasty Necron units gain the Necron Dynasty (Mephrit) special rule, which grants the Solar Fury advanced reaction and Stellar Destruction special rule, alongside providing access to certain pieces of wargear..

\textbf{Advanced Reaction (Solar Fury):} This Advanced Reaction may be made once per battle during the opposing player’s Shooting phase when any enemy unit declares a Shooting Attack targeting a friendly unit under the Reactive player’s control composed entirely of models with the Necron Dynasty (Mephrit) special rule. Once the Active player has resolved all To Hit and To Wound rolls, and Armour Saves are made, but before any Damage Mitigation rolls are made or casualties removed, the Reactive player may make a Shooting Attack, targeting the unit that triggered this Reaction, with all weapons increasing their AP by 1 but gaining the Gets Hot special rule. To Hit rolls for weapons that already possess the Gets Hot special rule trigger that special rule on a roll of 1 or 2 during this Shooting Attack, instead of only on a 1. A unit that makes a Solar Fury as part of a Solar Fury Reaction may not make any attacks indirectly (without line of sight) including weapons with the Barrage special rule or other weapon or special rule that otherwise ignore line of sight, and Vehicles may only fire Defensive weapons. Template weapons used as part of a Solar Fury Reaction use the Wall of Death rule instead of firing normally.

\textbf{Necron Dynasty (Mephrit) (Stellar Destructors):} When rolling for scatter for Blast weapons, instead of rolling 2D6 roll D6.
