\textbf{Necron Dynasty (Maynarkh) (Cursed Awakening):} When a unit made up of entirely models with the Necron Dynasty (Maynarkh) special rule attacks during the Fight phase against an enemy unit that is Pinned, Falling Back, or outnubmered by the attack unit it gets a +1 to all To Wound or Armour Penetration rolls made during the Assault. Futhermore if one or more models with this special rule are part of a combat that results in a draw, then the side that includes one or more models at the end of the fight sub-phase with this special rule is counted as having won the combat by 1 point. If both sides include models with this special rule then the combat remains a draw.

Once the Active player has resolved all To Hit and To Wound rolls, and Armour Saves are made, but before any Damage Mitigation rolls are made or casualties removed, the Reactive player may make a Shooting Attack, targeting the unit that triggered this Reaction, with all weapons increasing their AP by 1 but gaining the Gets Hot special rule. To Hit rolls for weapons that already possess the Gets Hot special rule trigger that special rule on a roll of 1 or 2 during this Shooting Attack, instead of only on a 1. A unit that makes a Solar Fury as part of a Solar Fury Reaction may not make any attacks indirectly (without line of sight) including weapons with the Barrage special rule or other weapon or special rule that otherwise ignore line of sight, and Vehicles may only fire Defensive weapons.
